### Main Information

2018, Ellenberg, Germany<br />
Size: 50Ã—60 cm<br />
Mural

Who among us was not delighted with this wonderful Damask pattern? Stylized flowers in parallel vertical rows and curved, intertwined
lines are typical of Damask patterns. Bring a luxurious touch to your home with this world-famous pattern!

I created this mixed media picture by hand and with much love on a painting cardboard using various techniques and high-quality materials
(acrylic paints, structure pastes, effect pastes, various types of paper, wax, various patinas, etc.). I used different shades of pink,
gray, and blue for this. The edges are also painted, and you can hang the picture without a frame.
