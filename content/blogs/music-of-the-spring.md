How beautiful is spring? What does it smell like? Have you ever thought about it? I’ve tried to visualize my ideas in this picture.

I’ve created this mixed-media picture by hand on a canvas with a lot of love using different techniques and high-quality materials
(acrylic paints, structure pastes, effect pastes, rice paper, clear varnish, various patinas, and other things). I’ve used different
colors for this: pink, blue, turquoise, beige, gold, and other. The edges are also painted, and you can hang the picture without a
frame. Unique picture.
